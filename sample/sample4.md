This contains a bunch of formulas! Also in lists as they usually are..

- initial state $x_0 = x(0)$, $T>0$, terminal state $x_T\in\mathbb{R}^n$
- **Controllability**
    - **controllable** if $\exists u: [0,T]\to\mathbb{R}^p$ input s.t. $x_0 = x_T, x(T) = 0$
    - = from any state → 0
    - $\mathcal{C}$ ... set of controllable states
- **Reachability**
    - **reachable** if $\exists u: [0,T]\to\mathbb{R}^p$ input s.t. $x_0 = 0, x(T) = x_T$
    - = from 0→ any state
    - $\mathcal{R}$... set of reachable states

Well, this it it.

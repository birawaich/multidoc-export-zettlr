# Bullet Lists
Quite frankly, bullet lists are powering my notes.

- I have a list
    - with a list in it
    - it has some bullets
        - and a sublist
        - with
        - more
        - bullets
    - but it closes
- eventually
    - might
        - go
            - in
                - completely
                    - to
                        - infinity
                            - and
                                - beyond
- Let's see if there is ever a use case for that…

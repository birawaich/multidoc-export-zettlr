<!--I AM A COMMENT. YOU WON'T SEE ME IN THE EXPORT.-->

# Heading 1

More text that I could not be bother to let ChatGPT create.

## Heading 2

More text! And a formula!

$$e^{i\pi}-1=0$$

### Heading 3

Bullet Lists seem to be the workhorse of notes. This is how the look like!

- I have a list
    - with a list in it
    - it has some bullets
        - and a sublist
        - with
        - more
        - bullets
    - but it closes
- eventually
    - might
        - go
            - in
                - complet…
                    - ...ely
                    - or
                    - so
             
...and since this is sample code meant to test out the document:

- This is another list
- with a bullet
	<!--and a comment that is complied! AHHH!-->
